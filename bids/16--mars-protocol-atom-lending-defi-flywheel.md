# About the Project

Mars Protocol is a DeFi credit and trading platform designed to unlock capital efficiency and drive liquidity across Cosmos ecosystems.
Operating on Neutron and Osmosis, the protocol enables over-collateralized borrowing, leveraged staking, and advanced trading strategies via its Red Bank and Rover functionalities.
Mars Protocol has been instrumental in driving adoption for ATOM liquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as dATOM and stATOM and aims to continue expanding ATOM-based DeFi strategies across the AEZ (Atom Economic Zone)

# Bid Description

## Use Case

This proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron.
By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral.
The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:

* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect.
This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.
* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps,
enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.
* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.

These strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.

## Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target

The tribute will be paid in MARS.
The PoL target is 200-300k ATOM.

The deployment duration will be 3 months.

* **Lower Borrow Rates:** By significantly increasing the ATOM lending pool, borrowing rates will decrease, making ATOM-based DeFi strategies more accessible and scalable.
* **Increase Liquidity Depth:** Targeting a lending pool depth of 200-300k ATOM, which will stabilize borrowing costs and enable impactful DeFi adoption.
* **Support ATOM-LST Ecosystem:** The proposal aligns with the broader goals of fostering ATOM-based liquidity and expanding the adoption of LSTs such as dATOM and stATOM.
* **Increased Participation:** Attract more participants to the AEZ's DeFi ecosystem by offering competitive and scalable strategies.

## Risk Mitigation and Security

* **Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default.
Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.
* **Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.
* **Audited Code:** Mars Protocol's contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms.
dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.
* **Emergency Contact:** An emergency contact for the Mars Protocol team has been shared with the Hydro committee for immediate risk management.

## Monitoring

All positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol's Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn).
Borrowing rates, utilization, and performance metrics will be transparently reported.
Additional liquidity metrics for LSTs can be tracked on Neutron and Astroport dashboards.

# Committee Review

Based on the current utilization rate and existing deposits, we recommend capping the bid at 200,000 ATOMs.
The committee will deploy liquidity up to this cap, while any excess liquidity will remain on standby.
This reserve will be gradually introduced by the committee as utilization levels increase.
