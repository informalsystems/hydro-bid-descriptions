# Bid Description

## Use case

Deploy dATOM<->ATOM LST LP to [White Whale DEX](https://app.whitewhale.money/terra/pools/manage_liquidity?poolId=ATOM-dATOM) on Terra 2.0.

The LP token will then be staked on Terra LP Alliance via the [Eris protocol](https://www.erisprotocol.com/), earning yield in LUNA or have the LP auto-compound into more dATOM<->ATOM LSD LP using the auto-compounding option as there is a 10% take rate on LP deposits when staking on Terra LP Alliance.
More on this in the next section:

## Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target

The tribute will be paid in USDC.
The PoL target is 3,000 ATOM.

The deployment duration will be 3 months.

Terra Liquidity Alliance built by Eris Protocol is a ve(3,3) mechanism that allows users to vote on where to direct native inflation on Terra 2.0.
The Migaloo Foundation, builders of White Whale DEX, control ~24% of the voting power on this Liquidity Alliance.
We have directed 10% of our controlled VP towards the dATOM/ATOM LP, building the liquidity up from $6k to $46k in just under one month.

The average APR for LST LPs on Eris Protocol (ampLUNA<->LUNA, bLUNA<->LUNA, dATOM<->ATOM) ~47%.

Below are yield ranges and the respective amount of total dATOM<->ATOM liquidity expected at those yields for dATOM<->ATOM:

**Highest** | *Net APR 80.35% = $46,550*
**Average** | *Net APR 47% = $91,500*
**Lowest** | *Net APR 25.53% = $172,000*

*Net APR = Gross LP Alliance Yield + Trading APR - 10% Take Rate on LP*

Below are the trading APRs for LSD LPs on Terra LP Alliance across all DEXs:

**Highest** | Trading APR = 2.10%
**Average** | Trading APR = 0.43%
**Lowest** | Trading APR = 0.07%

## Risk mitigation and Security

LPing will be subject to cap the bid at 33% of total existing deposits.
The White Whale team will monitor future deposits to the LP.

# Committee Review

Given the increased liability risks associated with the 10% take rate on LP deposits under the Terra Liquidity Alliance protocol,
the committee has decided to limit this bid to the minimum tranche amount of 10,000 ATOMs.
This cap, applied at the protocol level, governs all deposits made through the Terra Liquidity Alliance.
Since the current bid only requests 3,000 ATOMs, we can fulfill the entire bid while adhering to risk mitigation measures.
Hydro will maintain this cap until the protocol incorporates slashing mechanisms in its v2 release.
Additionally, Hydro's deployment will utilize the auto-compounding version to offset LP dilution through incentives.
