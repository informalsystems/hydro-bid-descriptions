# Bid Description

## Use case

Deploy dATOM<>ATOM LST LP to [White Whale DEX](https://app.whitewhale.money/terra/pools/manage_liquidity?poolId=ATOM-dATOM) on Terra 2.0

The LP token will then be staked on Terra LP Alliance via the [Eris protocol](https://www.erisprotocol.com/) earning yield in LUNA or have the LP auto-compound into more dATOM<>ATOM LSD LP using the auto-compounding option as there is a 10% take rate on LP deposits when staking on Terra LP Alliance.

## Performance Goals

 Terra Liquidity Alliance built by Eris Protocol is a ve(3,3) mechanism that allows users to vote on where to direct native inflation on Terra 2.0. The Migaloo Foundation, builders of White Whale DEX, control ~24% of the voting power on this Liquidity Alliance. The Foundation will be directing an additional 3%-5% of its total voting power (VP) towards the dATOM<>ATOM LST LP. The rewards for this gauge are currently on its 3rd week of a 4 week ramp period where rewards double each week. With the proposed VP changes and another week of increased rewards, we estimate there to be ~$6k in annual rewards available for the dATOM<>ATOM LST LP The average APR for LST LPs on Eris Protocol (ampLUNA<>LUNA, bLUNA<>LUNA, dATOM<>ATOM) ~22%. Below are yield ranges and the respective amount of total dATOM<>ATOM  liquidity expected at those yields for dATOM<>ATOM:

Highest  |  Net APR 40.97% = $11,771

Average |  Net APR 22.00% = $18,750

Lowest   |  Net APR 11.72% = $26,408

Net APR = Gross LP Alliance Yield + Trading APR - 10% Take Rate on LP

Below are the trading APRs for LSD LPs on Terra LP Alliance across all DEXs:

Highest  | Trading APR = 1.04%

Average | Trading APR =  0.53%

Lowest   | Trading APR = 0.10%

## Monitoring

 The LP may be monitored on Eris Protocol [here](https://www.erisprotocol.com/terra/liquidity-hub?tab=liquidity)

## Tribute & Target

The tribute will be paid in USDC. The PoL target is 2,000 ATOM.
