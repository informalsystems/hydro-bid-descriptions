# About the Project

Phoenix Directive and Phoenix Foundation were recently established by the Terra community with the responsibility to take over chain management & development responsibilities from TFL. Central to this is continuing to maintain and enhance Terra's core chain operations, system stability, and quality engineering development. This transition, along with the establishment and funding of the Phoenix Treasury is now complete. Phoenix Directive is also leading development and support initiatives with Terra's communities & projects. Our current focus is  building out an ecosystem of DeFi applications, growing our active user community, and establishing strong partnerships and integrations throughout Cosmos.

 Terra's Liquidity Alliance (LA) is the first initiative of Phoenix Directive. Liquidity Alliance is an advanced ve [3,3] mechanism DeFi protocol that converts staking rewards into incentives used for liquidity providers and voters to create a positive liquidity feedback loop. Powered by the Alliance SDK, it enables the development of deep liquidity for tokens and projects on Terra and is a foundational project for Terra's future growth. Launched only  2 months ago, Liquidity Alliance has achieved a TVL of $3-4m while offering annual rewards targeted at $4-5m (currently ~$2.4m). 

# Bid Description

## Use case

Adding DEX LPing on Astroport on Terra on the ATOM/dATOM and ATOM/stATOM pairs.
The deployment in each pair will depend on the overall depth the LST providers are able to acquire on Terra over the next 20 days until the bidding process ends.
We target that the Hydro allocation will be 33% of the total pool size.

Independent of the Hydro bid, PD will incentivize voting participation in [Terra Liquidity Alliance](https://docs.erisprotocol.com/products/liquidity-hub/)
and direct incentives to reward users and liquidity providers to provide liquidity on Terra.

Users will be able to deposit ATOM on ERIS Protocol [here](https://www.erisprotocol.com/terra/liquidity-hub?tab=liquidity) and participate in the incentives.
Current incentives to ATOM-LST pairs is ~45k $ per year to be increased by voting.

Phoenix Directive is interested in building long-term deep liquidity of ATOM on Terra and is interested in a continued participation in Hydro bidding and tribute process.

## Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target

The tribute will be paid in USDC.
The PoL target is 30,000 ATOM.

The deployment duration will be 3 months.

ATOM -> dATOM/stATOM conversion does not incur any cost.
The current pool APR is 0.84%, and we expect this to fluctuate around 1% for the next month.

The target for the next 20 days is reaching a depth of 250k $ worth of ATOM/ATOM-LST liquidity, before the first period of Hydro ends.

## Risk mitigation and Security

LPing will be capped so that Hydro does not exceed 33% of the total pool depth for each LST provider.

Liquidity Alliance from ERIS has been audited and can be found [here](https://github.com/SCV-Security/PublicReports/blob/main/Eris%20Protocol/ERIS%20-%20Contracts%20ve3%20-%20Audit%20Report%20v1.0.pdf).
(Hydro funds for the first bidding round will not be deployed into Liquidity Alliance.)

dATOM: The Drop code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/drop-contracts).
The current on-chain code is audited by OAK security and can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/main/Drop).

stATOM: Stride audits can be found [here](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/audits).

Astroport: Astroport audits can be found [here](https://docs.astroport.fi/docs/overview/security/audits).

An emergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.

## Monitoring

The LP may be monitored on Astroport Pools UI:

[Astroport ATOM/dATOM pool](https://app.astroport.fi/pools/terra1a0h6vrzkztjystg8sd949qyrc6mw9gzxk2870cr2mukg53uzgvqs46qul9)

[Astroport ATOM/stATOM pool](https://app.astroport.fi/pools/terra1f9vmtntpjmkyhkxtlc49jcq6cv8rfz0kr06zv6efdtdgae4m9y9qlzm36t)

## Deployment

# Committee Review

The Hydro committee will gradually allocate the 30,000 ATOM, ensuring Hydro's participation stays below 33% of total LP shares. As Terra's Liquidity Alliance boosts pool liquidity with incentives over time, Hydro's committee should monitor and adjust allocations proportionally. Should Hydro's share exceed 50%, the committee will reassess and reduce its position to align with the 33% target
