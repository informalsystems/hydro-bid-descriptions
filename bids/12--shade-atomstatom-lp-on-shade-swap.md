# About the Project

Shade Protocol is a suite of DeFi applications built on Secret Network that provides data confidentiality by default.

Shade's DeFi suite currently includes privacy-preserving DEX, CDP stablecoin pegged to a basket of currencies and commodities, bonds, LSTs, as well as a privacy-preserving Money Market planning to be launched in Q1 '24.Value accrual for all the Shade apps goes back to the SHD token.

All contract interaction data including token balances, tx history, and allowances are only visible to the data's owner by default,which provides protection from value extraction across all of Shade's apps.

# Bid Description

## Use case

Pairing stATOM/ATOM in Shade's DEX on Secret Network in the existing LP.

stATOM is used as collateral to mint out SILK on Shade Protocol (over $1M+ TVL) with the ShadeDAO holding over $30k+ of ATOM.

Shade is focused on expanding and growing ATOM liquidity.

## Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target

The tribute will be paid in SHD tokens.

The PoL target is 10,000 ATOM.

The deployment duration will be 3 months.

The expected APY is around 20%, with the addition of 2-4% in trading fees.

## Risk mitigation and Security

LP Bid Limitation: LPing will be subject to cap the bid at 33% of total existing deposits, we will monitor future deposits to the LP.

The Shade Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/securesecrets/shade), the current on-chain code is audited by Certic and can be found [here](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/shade-protocol). The documentation for the Shade protocol can be found [here](https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol). Emergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.

## Monitoring

The committee may monitor the position [here](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/pools) and search by ATOM/stATOM and select the appropriate pool. This will display assets held by the account and give projected performance.
