# Bid Description

## Use case

Pairing stATOM/ATOM in the Shade's DEX on Secret Network in the existing LP. stATOM is used as collateral to mint out SILK on Shade Protocol (over $1M+ TVL) with the ShadeDAO holding over $30k+ of ATOM. Shade is focused on expanding and growing ATOM liquidity.

## Performance goals
