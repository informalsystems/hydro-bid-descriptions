# About the Project

Amulet is a non-custodial, decentralised platform enabling self-repaying loans on staked assets. The focus is on one key function - unlocking ecosystem liquidity and capital efficiency for users through synthetics that represent future ATOM staking rewards 1:1 and mirror the market value of ATOM closely. To do this, we need deep liquidity pools between amATOM (the synthetic that represents future ATOM staking rewards) and ATOM/ATOM LSTs to maintain a close peg.

# Bid Description

## Use case

We are bidding to retain our current supplied liquidity in both the amATOM/dATOM and amATOM/stATOM LPs on Astroport.

This allocation will continue to be used to deepen liquidity between amATOM and dATOM/stATOM/ATOM to peg amATOM to the market value of ATOM as closely as possible.

We want to contribute to the future success of ATOM within DeFi on Cosmos, and across the entire IBC and this allocation would help ensure there is enough liquidity to make accessing Amulet staking advances valuable and attractive to ATOM holders.

For Hydro itself, both the amATOM/stATOM and amATOM/dATOM LP pools are low-risk and allows full directional exposure to the upside price appreciation of ATOM in bullish market conditions.

## Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target

The tribute will be paid in Ingots. There will be 375,000 Ingots (0.66% of current Ingot supply) to be distributed pro-rata among voters, based on voting power. The liquidity target is 10,000 ATOM. The deployment duration will be 3 months. The current pool APR is estimated to be 0.05%, which comes from swap fees, and additionally Hydro will earn Ingots that represent allocation of the upcoming AMLT airdrop.

## Risk mitigation

Hydro retains complete control of their LP and it can be withdrawn with immediate effect. amATOM represents future ATOM staking rewards on Amulet's auto-repaying staking advance protocol so the value of amATOM is always representative to an equivalent amount of ATOM generated by future staking rewards.

## Security

Amulet has been audited by Oak Security, and their audit can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/main/Amulet). Amulet has also been audited by Resonance Cybersecurity, and their audit can be found [here](https://github.com/ResonanceCybersecurity/audits/blob/main/CosmWasm%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Audit_Report_AMLT-PRO_FINAL_2.2.pdf). Emergency security contact has been provided to the hydro committee.

# Committee Review

Reviewed by Phil_RX on 26-Apr: The presented strategy offers interesting opportunities with limited risks. Contracts are audited which allows Hydro to apply the bootstrapping framework and support the project with an initial 10K ATOM injection. Assuming rising demand for deposits in the pool, the project may be able to request more in the future. Hydro LP deposits would then be subject to the 50% share (after deposit) cap in the pools.
