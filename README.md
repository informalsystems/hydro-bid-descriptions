# hydro-bid-descriptions
This repository contains the descriptions and metadata for proposals on the Hydro liquidity auction platform.

We keep these descriptions off-chain to allow for transparent yet easy to manage updates
during the pilot rounds of Hydro. Allowing updates of the information on-chain is
not trivial, because the intention of the bids should not be able to be changed,
but minor corrections and clarifications should be able to be added while we
are working out templates and processes.

This information is expected to live on-chain in the future.

The bid information is stored in the `bid-description.json` file.
