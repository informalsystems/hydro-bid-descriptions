    "title": "Demex ATOM Lending Supply Proposal",
    "description": "### Use case\n\nDeploying ATOM liquidity to Demex's lending market through a phased implementation approach. This will increase the available ATOM for borrowing, potentially reducing borrowing rates and improving overall market efficiency. The supplied ATOM will be used exclusively within Demex's lending protocol, allowing users to borrow ATOM at more competitive rates.\n\nThis bid aims to enhance Demex's ATOM lending market liquidity through a cautious, phased approach. It prioritizes transparency and community involvement while seeking to benefit both lenders and borrowers in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n### Performance goals\n\nThe performance of this proposal can be monitored through Demex's lending market interface called [Nitron]([https://app.dem.exchange/nitron](https://app.dem.exchange/nitron) ), which will display:  \n1. Total ATOM supplied  \n2. Utilization rate  \n3. Supply APY  \n4. Borrow APY\n\nThe current lending APY for ATOM is at 14% and the borrowing rate is at 23% due to high borrowing demand and insufficient lending supply. The additional ATOM supply will help reduce the ATOM borrowing rate while keeping the lending APY competitive. \n\nHydro Committee can also monitor the performance of deployed liquidity on the following [link](https://scan.carbon.network/cdp/ibc%2FA4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701?net=main).\n\nWe project the supply APY for ATOM to be competitive with other lending platforms, estimated at 5-8% APY (variable based on market conditions). \n\n### Tribute & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in SWTH. The PoL target is 10,000 ATOM.\n\nPhased Supply Target\n\n* Phase 1 (Initial): 10,000 ATOM  \n* Phase 2 (Evaluation): Monitor for 1 month  \n* Phase 3 (Scaling): Gradually increase the target in the coming rounds to 50,000 ATOM, based on performance and demand\n\n### Risk mitigation\n\nWe will start with a smaller supply to assess the market dynamic. We will monitor the utilization rate to ensure it remains at a healthy level, with a target at 70-80%. Demex also uses a dynamic interest rate model that adjusts based on utilization, helping to maintain market balance\n\nATOM's LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) on Demex is set at 70% which is competitive while remaining safe due to the deep liquidity that ATOM possess\n\nDemex will also provide a withdrawal guarantee. If ATOM cannot be withdrawn at the end of the loan period due to high utilization, additional ATOM will be added to the pool to ensure all loans are repaid.\n\nWe will also have a dedicated team that will monitor the market health and performance of the Demex platform.\n\n### Security  \nThe Demex code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-js-sdk), the current on-chain code is audited by Peck Shield and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BCgTTyFNW946Z1N-Hxqyz7uGLApF75EM).

    "description": "### Use case\n\nUtilizing stATOM to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and entering short positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit's value from the stATOM lending pool. The loan is denominated in stATOM and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially shorting stATOM. This means that if the value of stATOM decreases, borrowers need less USDC to pay back their stATOM-denominated debt and they can keep the rest as profit. If the value of stATOM increases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to stATOM to pay back the lenders.\n\n### Performance goals\n\nThe Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range between 4-6%. The position can be monitored at [https://app.nolus.io/stats](https://app.nolus.io/stats)\n\n### Tribute & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in NLS tokens. The PoL target is 5,000 ATOM.\n\n### Risk mitigation\n\nBoth the deposit and the loan in stATOM get swapped to USDC. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss, nor will it be traded against borrowers. This design ensures that the lent liquidity remains secure.\n\n### Security\n\nThe Nolus Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol).

    "description": "#### Use case\n\nDeploying ATOM liquidity to Demex's lending market through a phased implementation approach.\nThis will increase the available ATOM for borrowing, potentially reducing borrowing rates and improving overall market efficiency.\nThe supplied ATOM will be used exclusively within Demex's lending protocol, allowing users to borrow ATOM at more competitive rates.\n\nThis bid aims to enhance Demex's ATOM lending market liquidity through a cautious, phased approach.\nIt prioritizes transparency and community involvement while seeking to benefit both lenders and borrowers in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n#### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in SWTH.\nThe PoL target is 10,000 ATOM.\n\nPhased Supply Target\n\n* Phase 1 (Initial): 10,000 ATOM\n* Phase 2 (Evaluation): Monitor for 1 month\n* Phase 3 (Scaling): Gradually increase the target in the coming rounds to 50,000 ATOM, based on performance and demand\n\nThe Deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\nThe current lending APY for ATOM is at 14% and the borrowing rate is at 23% due to high borrowing demand and insufficient lending supply.\nThe additional ATOM supply will help reduce the ATOM borrowing rate while keeping the lending APY competitive.\n\nWe project the supply APY for ATOM to be competitive with other lending platforms, estimated at 5-8% APY (variable based on market conditions).\n\n#### Risk mitigation and Security\n\nWe will start with a smaller supply to assess the market dynamic.\nWe will monitor the utilization rate to ensure it remains at a healthy level, with a target at 70-80%.\nDemex also uses a dynamic interest rate model that adjusts based on utilization, helping to maintain market balance.\n\nATOM's LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) on Demex is set at 70%, which is competitive while remaining safe due to the deep liquidity that ATOM possess.\n\nDemex will also provide a withdrawal guarantee.\nIf ATOM cannot be withdrawn at the end of the loan period due to high utilization, additional ATOM will be added to the pool to ensure all loans are repaid.\n\nWe will also have a dedicated team that will monitor the market health and performance of the Demex platform.\n\nThe Demex code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-js-sdk).\nThe current on-chain code is audited by Peck Shield and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BCgTTyFNW946Z1N-Hxqyz7uGLApF75EM).\nThe documentation for Demex can be found [here](https://guide.dem.exchange/) and [here](https://docs.carbon.network/carbon-core/collateralized-debt-position-cdp-module/cdp-operations/borrow).\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the hydro committee.\n\n#### Monitoring\n\nThe performance of this proposal can be monitored through Demex's lending market interface called [Nitron](https://app.dem.exchange/nitron), which will display:\n1. Total ATOM supplied\n2. Utilization rate\n3. Supply APY\n4. Borrow APY\n\nHydro Committee can also monitor the performance of deployed liquidity on the following [link](https://scan.carbon.network/cdp/ibc%2FA4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701?net=main).\n\n#### Deployment\n\nThe ATOM will be supplied to the following Demex lending market contract address:\nswth1wq9ts6l7atfn45ryxrtg4a2gwegsh3xh7w83xl",

    "description": "#### Use Case\n\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron.\nBy increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral.\nThe borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect.\nThis strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.\n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps,\nenabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.\n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\n\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n\n#### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS.\nThe PoL target is 200-300k ATOM.\n\nThe deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\n* **Lower Borrow Rates:** By significantly increasing the ATOM lending pool, borrowing rates will decrease, making ATOM-based DeFi strategies more accessible and scalable.\n* **Increase Liquidity Depth:** Targeting a lending pool depth of 200-300k ATOM, which will stabilize borrowing costs and enable impactful DeFi adoption.\n* **Support ATOM-LST Ecosystem:** The proposal aligns with the broader goals of fostering ATOM-based liquidity and expanding the adoption of LSTs such as dATOM and stATOM.\n* **Increased Participation:** Attract more participants to the AEZ's DeFi ecosystem by offering competitive and scalable strategies.\n\n#### Risk Mitigation and Security\n\n* **Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default.\nBorrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n* **Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n* **Audited Code:** Mars Protocol's contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms.\ndATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\n* **Emergency Contact:** An emergency contact for the Mars Protocol team has been shared with the Hydro committee for immediate risk management.\n\n#### Monitoring\n\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol's Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn).\nBorrowing rates, utilization, and performance metrics will be transparently reported.\nAdditional liquidity metrics for LSTs can be tracked on Neutron and Astroport dashboards.\n\n#### Deployment\n\nneutron10xwzc88kefwtlup9c2tmw4mj4ng7u79g8lsapp0c9jc02xt247zqwzzghf",

    "aboutProject": "Neptune Finance is a next-generation credit network and high-yield lending protocol designed to provide unmatched capital efficiency for lenders, borrowers, and builders. Neptune rates lead the market by dynamically shifting to encourage borrowing and ultimately deliver a narrower spread between lend and borrow rates, constantly calibrating to the most competitive rate. Using DeFi modularity, Neptune's lend receipt tokens (or nAssets) can be reused in other protocols such as Pryzm and Astroport.",
    "description": "### Use case\n\nATOM liquidity will be used in a strategic partnership between Drop and Neptune to bootstrap liquidity requirements for listing dATOM on Neptune. This will mark the first ATOM LST deployment on the Injective chain, and the second LST listing on Neptune after hINJ.\n\nOnce requirements are met, dATOM will be enabled as a yield-bearing collateral asset on Neptune, allowing users to borrow against it in cross-margin accounts. Supporting this deployment, an nATOM/dATOM pair will be seeded on Astroport Injective to be used as a liquidation route and as a yield-farming opportunity for ATOM on Injective.\n\nFirst, ATOM liquidity will be deposited in [Neptune Lend](https://app.nept.finance/lend/), which can be borrowed by third parties with over-collateralized positions to generate returns from the cost of borrowing. Deposits mint nATOM, the yield-bearing receipt token.\n\nSecond, a maximum of 5,000 nATOM will be used to seed the nATOM/dATOM LP on Astroport, with the other half provided by Drop as dATOM for a total of 10,000 ATOM.\n\nWe intend to grow nATOM/dATOM liquidity through different incentive mechanisms in the coming months in order to meet the dATOM listing requirements. This Hydro bid marks the first step towards achieving that goal.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC. In this pilot phase, the PoL target is 10,000 ATOM. The deployment duration will be 3 months. The historic 30-day average return for ATOM lending is between 2.1% and 7.50% APY. nATOM deposited on Astroport in the nATOM/dATOM LP will earn additional yield based on swap fees.\n\n### Risk mitigation\n\nThe target PoL will account for roughly 40% of the lending pool. Should ATOM loans exceed past target utilization levels, the dynamic Neptune interest rate model will increase exponentially and incentivize the return of loans.\n\nThe committee will also hold the nATOM receipt token for their deposit position and can trade it on the open market if needed.\n\n### Security\n\nOak Security has audited Neptune Finance; the audit can be found [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Neptune).  \nNeptune's docs can be found [here](https://docs.nept.finance/).\n\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nThe committee may monitor the performance of ATOM lending via the Neptune lending [page](https://app.nept.finance/asset-details/?denom=ibc%2FC4CFF46FD6DE35CA4CF4CE031E643C8FDC9BA4B99AE598E9B0ED98FE3A2319F9) and the nATOM/dATOM pool on Astroport UI [here](https://app.astroport.fi/pools/inj18ucwme9nyemev9cjhy6jtagtu4laxh7ztzeqqc).\n\nOur venue queries can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@jwEKz2IPTTqH3U9DC2aZ3A/BkShOvGc1x).\n\n### Deployment\n\nNeptune Money Market Contract:  \nInj1nc7gjkf2mhp34a6gquhurg8qahnw5kxs5u3s4u\n\nAstroport nATOM/dATOM Contract:  \ninj18ucwme9nyemev9cjhy6jtagtu4laxh7ztzeqqc\n\nOur deployment example transaction can be viewed [here](https://explorer.injective.network/transaction/50720C355D377BB175F4CDE7004CBF90453854D0DCDF37C5FEC240A112C84221/) and [here](https://explorer.injective.network/transaction/B0AFFB880DCAA2FAD22A0536D110F1D47D9C27DD26A8D4CEC74DB85615185D82/).",

Additionally, ShadeSwap will have a concentrated liquidity pool for ATOM <-> xATOM, allowing lenders of ATOM to swiftly and efficiently exit lending positions on the fly without concern for current utilization rates.\n\n### Security\n\nShadeX has received a 4 month internal audit, as well as an external audit by Halborn which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7Upscf3ynBpmDc0-h_YM9IJlBSauX9_/view?usp=drive_link).\n\n[ShadeX documentation](https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/advanced-topics-apps/shadex-money-market) includes details on key features for lenders and borrowers, liquidations, risk management, configurations, and fees.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nThe committee can monitor the ATOM vault as well as their lent ATOM position on ShadeX [here](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/lend).\n\nThe committee can find details about the ATOM vault on ShadeX via CLI by using this command:\n\nSecretcli q compute query secret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud '{\"get_vault\": {\"token\": \"secret19e75l25r6sa6nhdf4lggjmgpw0vmpfvsw5cnpe\"}}'\n\n### Deployment\n\nThe ShadeX contract address is secret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud (codehash: 36823f966e139dc2d6c3ad7c8b0cb29a808d08daaf0957815369de8d925404ac)\n\nThe SNIP20 contract address for ATOM is secret19e75l25r6sa6nhdf4lggjmgpw0vmpfvsw5cnpe (codehash: 638a3e1d50175fbcb8373cf801565283e3eb23d88a9b7b7f99fcc5eb1e6b561e)\n\nExample ATOM lending txs on ShadeX can be found here including decrypted tx logs:\n\nTx hash for lending ATOM on ShadeX: [https://secretnodes.com/secret/transactions/958E7B89D31BEB6B02B9BC8737D861E7A574795A8512DC89DA5C42A5436AB548](https://secretnodes.com/secret/transactions/958E7B89D31BEB6B02B9BC8737D861E7A574795A8512DC89DA5C42A5436AB548)\n\nExecute Msg for ATOM SNIP20, where msg is Base64 encoded:\n\n{\n  \"send\": {\n    \"recipient\": \"secret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud\",\n    \"recipient_code_hash\": \"36823f966e139dc2d6c3ad7c8b0cb29a808d08daaf0957815369de8d925404ac\",\n    \"amount\": \"1000000\",\n    \"msg\": \"eyJzdXBwbHkiOnt9fQ==\",\n    \"padding\": \"TMWzfPRbLx2\"\n  }\n}",

    "projectLogoUrl": "/images/logo-mars.png",
    "aboutProject": "Mars Protocol is a DeFi credit and trading platform designed to unlock capital efficiency and drive liquidity across Cosmos ecosystems. Operating on Neutron and Osmosis, the protocol enables over-collateralized borrowing, leveraged staking, and advanced trading strategies via its Red Bank and Rover functionalities. Mars Protocol has been instrumental in driving adoption for ATOM liquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as dATOM and stATOM and aims to continue expanding ATOM-based DeFi strategies across the AEZ (Atom Economic Zone).",
    "description": "### Use Case\n\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron. By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral. The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect. This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.\n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps, enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.\n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\n\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS and NTRN. The PoL target is 150k ATOM and the expected APR is 6-7% (ATOM lending APY). The deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n**Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default. Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n\n**Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n\n### Security\n\nMars Protocol's contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms. dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\n\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol's Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn). Borrowing rates, utilization, and performance metrics will be transparently reported. Additional liquidity metrics for LSTs can be tracked on Neutron and Astroport dashboards.\n\nOur venue queries can be viewed here.\n\n### Deployment\n\nLiquidity to be deployed to:\n\nhttps://daodao.zone/dao/neutron10xwzc88kefwtlup9c2tmw4mj4ng7u79g8lsapp0c9jc02xt247zqwzzghf/apps?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.marsprotocol.io and it should load the Mars app and you could see in that CA #403 there is ~203,840 ATOM deposited into Mars\n\nhttps://neutron.celat.one/neutron-1/contracts/neutron1qdzn3l4kn7gsjna2tfpg3g3mwd6kunx4p50lfya59k02846xas6qslgs3r is the Mars Credit Manager - this is where all transactions will be executed against (including through the DAODAO link above)\n\nhttps://neutron.celat.one/neutron-1/contracts/neutron1n97wnm7q6d2hrcna3rqlnyqw2we6k0l8uqvmyqq6gsml92epdu7quugyph is the red bank - this is the money market portion of Mars, when you do the lend of ATOM so it can earn yield (via being borrowed out to depositors) the credit manager essentially deposits this amount into the red bank contract.",

Central to this is continuing to maintain and enhance Terra's core chain operations, system stability, and quality engineering development. This transition, along with the establishment and funding of the Phoenix Treasury is now complete. Phoenix Directive is also leading development and support initiatives with Terra's communities & projects. Our current focus is  building out an ecosystem of DeFi applications, growing our active user community, and establishing strong partnerships and integrations throughout Cosmos.\nTerra's Liquidity Alliance (LA) is the first initiative of Phoenix Directive. Liquidity Alliance is an advanced ve [3,3] mechanism DeFi protocol that converts staking rewards into incentives used for liquidity providers and voters to create a positive liquidity feedback loop. Powered by the Alliance SDK, it enables the development of deep liquidity for tokens and projects on Terra and is a foundational project for Terra's future growth. Launched only 6 months ago, Liquidity Alliance has achieved a TVL of $4m while offering annual rewards targeted at $3m.",
    "description": "### Use case\nAdding DEX LPing on Astroport on Terra on the ATOM/dATOM and ATOM/stATOM pairs. The deployment in each pair will depend on the overall depth the LST providers are able to acquire on Terra over the next 20 days until the bidding process ends. We target that the hydro allocation will be 50% of the total pool size.\nIndependent of the Hydro bid, PD will incentivize voting participation in [Terra Liquidity Alliance](https://docs.erisprotocol.com/products/liquidity-hub/) and direct incentives to reward users and liquidity providers to provide liquidity on Terra. Users will be able to deposit ATOM on ERIS Protocol [here](https://www.erisprotocol.com/terra/liquidity-hub?tab=liquidity) and participate in the incentives. Current incentives to ATOM-LST pairs is ~ 150k $ per year to be increased by voting. Phoenix Directive is interested in building long term deep liquidity of ATOM on Terra and is interested in a continued participation in Hydro bidding and tribute process.\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC. The PoL target is 50,000 ATOM. The deployment duration will be 3 months. ATOM -> dATOM/stATOM conversion does not incur any cost.

    "title": "Nolus: USDC Liquidity Lending",
    "projectLogoUrl": "/images/logo-nolus.png",
    "aboutProject": "Nolus Protocol is a Web3 financial suite that offers an innovative approach to money markets with a novel Lease solution to develop the DeFi space further. The DeFi Lease defines a money market between lenders looking to earn yield on stablecoins, and borrowers, looking to borrow more digital assets than their current equity. To borrow assets, the borrower locks up a down payment as collateral and can leverage their holdings in a preferred digital asset.",
    "description": "### Use case\n\nUtilizing USDC to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and enter long positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit's value from the USDC lending pool. The loan is denominated in USDC and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially longing the asset of choice by a maximum of 2.5x leverage. This means that if the asset's value increases, borrowers can profit from the price appreciation. If the value of the leveraged asset decreases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to USDC to pay back the lenders.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC tokens. The PoL target is the full 57.5k bucket. The deployment duration will be 1 month. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range around 16% at current utilization thresholds (94%) and is paid out in USDC from the interest borrowers pay to lenders. There is no manual claiming of rewards, rewards are accrued to the position, so the withdrawable amount increases as time passes. The utilization levels can be monitored [here](https://app.nolus.io/stats).\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\nBoth the deposit and the loan in USDC are swapped for a supported asset of choice for longing on Nolus. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss or traded against borrowers. This design ensures that the lent liquidity remains secure.\n\n### Security\n\nThe Nolus Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol). Oak Security and Halborn audit the current on-chain code, and their audits can be found [here](https://hub.nolus.io/en/articles/9680739-security).

    "description": "### Use Case\n\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron. By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral. The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect. This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.\n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps, enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.\n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\n\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS and NTRN. The PoL target is 150k ATOM and the expected APR is 6-7 (ATOM lending APY)%. The deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n**Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default. Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n\n**Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n\n### Security\n\nMars Protocol's contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms. dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\n\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol's Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn).

    "title": "Nolus: USDC Lending Liquidity",
    "projectLogoUrl": "/images/logo-nolus.png",
    "aboutProject": "Nolus Protocol offers a new approach to money markets with a novel Lease solution to develop the DeFi space further. The DeFi Lease defines a money market between lenders looking to earn yield on stablecoins, and borrowers, looking to borrow more digital assets than their current equity. To borrow assets, the borrower locks up a down payment as collateral and can leverage their holdings in a preferred digital asset.",
    "description": "### Use case\nUtilizing USDC to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and enter long positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit's value from the USDC lending pool. The loan is denominated in USDC and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially longing the asset of choice by a maximum of 2.5x leverage. This means that if the asset's value increases, borrowers can profit from the price appreciation. If the value of the leveraged asset decreases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to USDC to pay back the lenders.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC tokens. The PoL target is the full 50k bucket. The deployment duration will be 1 month. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range around 14% at current utilization thresholds (82.5%) and is paid out in USDC from the interest borrowers pay to lenders. There is no manual claiming of rewards, rewards are accrued to the position, so the withdrawable amount increases as time passes. The utilization levels can be monitored [here](https://app.nolus.io/stats).\n\n### Risk Mitigation\nBoth the deposit and the loan in USDC are swapped for a supported asset of choice for longing on Nolus. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss or traded against borrowers.

The DeFi Lease defines a money market between lenders looking to earn yield on stablecoins, and borrowers, looking to borrow more digital assets than their current equity. To borrow assets, the borrower locks up a down payment as collateral and can leverage their holdings in a preferred digital asset.",
    "description": "### Use case\nUtilizing USDC to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and enter long positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit's value from the USDC lending pool. The loan is denominated in USDC and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially longing the asset of choice by a maximum of 2.5x leverage. This means that if the asset's value increases, borrowers can profit from the price appreciation. If the value of the leveraged asset decreases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to USDC to pay back the lenders.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC tokens. The PoL target is the full 50k bucket. The deployment duration will be 1 month. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range around 14% at current utilization thresholds (82.5%) and is paid out in USDC from the interest borrowers pay to lenders. There is no manual claiming of rewards, rewards are accrued to the position, so the withdrawable amount increases as time passes. The utilization levels can be monitored [here](https://app.nolus.io/stats).\n\n### Risk Mitigation\nBoth the deposit and the loan in USDC are swapped for a supported asset of choice for longing on Nolus. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss or traded against borrowers. This design ensures that the lent liquidity remains secure.\n\n### Security\nThe Nolus Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol). Oak Security and Halborn audit the current on-chain code, and their audits can be found [here](https://hub.nolus.io/en/articles/9680739-security). The documentation for the Nolus protocol can be found [here](https://hub.nolus.io/en/collections/10034429-tech-documentation).\n\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\nThe committee may monitor the position using the Nolus dApp UI found [here](https://app.nolus.io/earn).\n\nOur venue queries can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/Vz5ts3lUSSaND7m2WwBcMQ).\n\n### Deployment\n`nolus1ueytzwqyadm6r0z8ajse7g6gzum4w3vv04qazctf8ugqrrej6n4sq027cf` - USDC lending pool\n\nOur deployment example transactions can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/Vz5ts3lUSSaND7m2WwBcMQ).",

    "description": "### Use Case\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron. By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral. The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect. This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.\n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps, enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.\n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\n\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS. The PoL target is 150k ATOM and the expected APR is 8-9% (ATOM lending APY). The deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n**Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default. Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n**Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n\n### Security\nMars Protocol's contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms. dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\n\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol's Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn).

To align with Hydro's early-stage protocol standards, the liquidation engine must operate with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) cap of approximately 66% for lending facilities. This precautionary measure ensures stability and mitigates risk during the initial phase. The LTV cap will be gradually lifted as liquidity conditions within the Cosmos ecosystem improve. The requested bid amount can't be delivered as Hydro shares a currently limited to 50% participation ratio (after deposit). Current deposits in the pool are too low. As such, the committee approved to renew the previous bootstrap framework which is capped at 10,000.",

    "aboutProject": "[Nolus Protocol](https://nolus.io/%20) is a Web3 financial suite that offers an innovative approach to money markets with a novel Lease solution to develop the DeFi space further.\nThe DeFi Lease defines a money market between lenders looking to earn yield on stablecoins, and borrowers, looking to borrow more digital assets than their current equity.\nTo borrow assets, the borrower locks up a down payment as collateral and can leverage their holdings in a preferred digital asset.",
    "description": "### Use case\nUtilizing ATOM to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and entering short positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit's value from the ATOM lending pool. The loan is denominated in ATOM and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially shorting ATOM. This means that if the value of ATOM decreases, borrowers need less USDC to pay back their ATOM-denominated debt and they can keep the rest as profit. If the value of ATOM increases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to ATOM to pay back the lenders.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in NLS tokens. The PoL target is 5,000 ATOM. The deployment duration will be 3 months. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range around 6.5% at optimal utilization thresholds (70%) and is paid out in ATOM from the interest borrowers pay to lenders. There is no manual claiming of rewards, rewards are accrued to the position, so the withdrawable amount increases as time passes. The utilization levels can be monitored [here](https://app.nolus.io/stats).\n\n### Risk Mitigation\nBoth the deposit and the loan in ATOM are swapped for USDC. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 66% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss or traded against borrowers. This design ensures that the lent liquidity remains secure.\n\n### Security\nThe Nolus Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol). Oak Security and Halborn audit the current on-chain code, and their audits can be found [here](https://hub.nolus.io/en/articles/9680739-security).

Additionally, ShadeSwap will have a concentrated liquidity pool for ATOM <> xATOM, allowing lenders of ATOM to swiftly and efficiently exit lending positions on the fly without concern for current utilization rates.\n\n### Security\nShadeX has received a 4 month internal audit, as well as an external audit by Halborn which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7Upscf3ynBpmDc0-h_YM9IJlBSauX9_/view?usp=drive_link).\n\n[ShadeX documentation](https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/advanced-topics-apps/shadex-money-market) includes details on key features for lenders and borrowers, liquidations, risk management, configurations, and fees.\n\n### Monitoring\nThe committee can monitor the ATOM vault as well as their lent ATOM position on ShadeX [here](https://app.shadeprotocol.io/lend).\n\nThe committee can find details about the ATOM vault on ShadeX via CLI by using this command:\nsecretcli q compute query secret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud '{\"get_vault\": {\"token\": \"secret19e75l25r6sa6nhdf4lggjmgpw0vmpfvsw5cnpe\"}}'\n\n### Deployment\nThe ShadeX contract address is:\nsecret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud\n\nShadeX contract codehash:\n36823f966e139dc2d6c3ad7c8b0cb29a808d08daaf0957815369de8d925404ac\n\nThe SNIP20 contract address for ATOM is:\nsecret19e75l25r6sa6nhdf4lggjmgpw0vmpfvsw5cnpe\n\nCodehash:\n638a3e1d50175fbcb8373cf801565283e3eb23d88a9b7b7f99fcc5eb1e6b561e\n\nExample ATOM lending txs on ShadeX can be found here including decrypted tx logs:\nTx hash for lending ATOM on ShadeX can be found [here](https://secretnodes.com/secret/transactions/958E7B89D31BEB6B02B9BC8737D861E7A574795A8512DC89DA5C42A5436AB548).\n\nExecute Msg for ATOM SNIP20, where msg is Base64 encoded:\n{\n  \"send\": {\n    \"recipient\": \"secret17xjvdnhxult4a0epa88cqyp8mh9z2y7jrlwkud\",\n    \"recipient_code_hash\": \"36823f966e139dc2d6c3ad7c8b0cb29a808d08daaf0957815369de8d925404ac\",\n    \"amount\": \"1000000\",\n    \"msg\": \"eyJzdXBwbHkiOnt9fQ==\",\n    \"padding\": \"TMWzfPRbLx2\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Security Review\nReviewed by Arlai on 27-June-2025: Based on the security review of Shade Protocol's ATOM/dATOM liquidity pool opportunity, this presents a **Low to Moderate** risk opportunity for Hydro liquidity provision.

To align with Hydro's early-stage protocol standards, the liquidation engine must operate with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) cap of approximately 66% for lending facilities. This precautionary measure ensures stability and mitigates risk during the initial phase. The LTV cap will be gradually lifted as liquidity conditions within the Cosmos ecosystem improve. The committee's risk management rule for lending protocols allows Hydro to match up to 50% of a pool's current liquidity, or a maximum of 10,000 ATOM if the pool has less than that. As such, the committee approves the full requested amount of 10,000 ATOM.",

    "description": "### Use Case\nWe aim to support Duality Supervaults by bootstrapping dATOM/ATOM. The LP will be managed by Duality, automatically [rebalancing the pair and capturing arbitrage](https://hadron.notion.site/Supervaults-Explainer-16485d6b9b1080a78d9dd60dfefed4d9#16485d6b9b1080518aaae92858288bbb) to optimize yield. [Duality Supervaults](https://hadron.notion.site/Supervaults-Explainer-16485d6b9b1080a78d9dd60dfefed4d9) are CosmWasm contracts that leverage the price feeds from Neutron’s enshrined oracle, Slinky, and native automation via the CRON module to provide liquidity with tight spreads on the Duality orderbook.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe target deployment amount is 50,000 ATOM. The deployment duration will be 3 months. The expected pool APR for Duality Supervaults dATOM/ATOM is around 5%; we expect this to fluctuate between 4-7% for the next month.\n\nThe tribute will be paid in Droplets (point system), which will be converted into DROP tokens upon the TGE. In total, 100 Million DROP tokens will be distributed to the Droplets owners in proportion to their share of the overall Droplet amount.

Operating on Neutron and Osmosis, the protocol enables over-collateralized borrowing, leveraged staking, and advanced trading strategies via its Red Bank and Rover functionalities. Mars Protocol has been instrumental in driving adoption for ATOM liquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as dATOM and stATOM and aims to continue expanding ATOM-based DeFi strategies across the AEZ (Atom Economic Zone).",
    "description": "### Use Case\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron. By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral. The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect. This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.\n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps, enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.\n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS. The PoL target is 150k ATOM and the expected APR is 9-11% (ATOM lending APY). The deployment duration will be 3 months.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n**Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default. Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n**Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n\n### Security\nMars Protocol’s contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms. dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Monitoring\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol’s Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn). Borrowing rates, utilization, and performance metrics will be transparently reported.

If the pool is unbalanced, Hydro would take an immediate loss. In order to prevent this, we recommend that Elys provides some collateral up front, which would be used to make Hydro’s position whole in the event of a loss. Our recommendation is a minimum 20% collateral in the form of USDC or ATOM.

    "projectLogoUrl": "/images/logo-nolus.png",
    "aboutProject": "[Nolus Protocol](https://nolus.io/) offers a new approach to money markets with a novel Lease solution to develop the DeFi space further. The DeFi Lease defines a money market between lenders looking to earn yield on stablecoins, and borrowers, looking to borrow more digital assets than their current equity. To borrow assets, the borrower locks up a down payment as collateral and can leverage their holdings in a preferred digital asset.",
    "description": "### Use case\nUtilizing USDC to provide loans to borrowers aiming to leverage their equity and enter long positions. Borrowers on Nolus provide a deposit (down payment) in the form of a supported asset and they can borrow up to 150% of that deposit’s value from the USDC lending pool. The loan is denominated in USDC and has a fixed interest rate. Both the deposit and the loan get transferred over to a supported network, in this case, Osmosis, and get swapped to USDC on the native decentralized exchange there, essentially longing the asset of choice by a maximum of 2.5x leverage. This means that if the asset's value increases, borrowers can profit from the price appreciation. If the value of the leveraged asset decreases, the position may face partial liquidation(s) where a portion of the position would get swapped back to USDC to pay back the lenders.\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in USDC tokens. The PoL target is the full 50k bucket. The deployment duration will be 1 month. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is projected to range around 14% at current utilization thresholds (82.5%) and is paid out in USDC from the interest borrowers pay to lenders. There is no manual claiming of rewards, rewards are accrued to the position, so the withdrawable amount increases as time passes. The utilization levels can be monitored [here](https://app.nolus.io/stats).\n### Risk Mitigation\nBoth the deposit and the loan in USDC are swapped for a supported asset of choice for longing on Nolus. The total amount acts as collateral for the position. A maximum 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio has been established as a safety precaution. Some borrowers may decide to have a lower initial LTV for their positions. A key advantage of the Nolus Protocol is its unique design of single-asset liquidity pools. Liquidity provided within these pools will not be subject to impermanent loss or traded against borrowers. This design ensures that the lent liquidity remains secure.\n### Security\nThe Nolus Protocol code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol). Oak Security and Halborn audit the current on-chain code, and their audits can be found [here](https://hub.nolus.io/en/articles/9680739-security).

Mars Protocol has been instrumental in driving adoption for ATOM liquid staking tokens (LSTs) such as dATOM and stATOM and aims to continue expanding ATOM-based DeFi strategies across the AEZ (Atom Economic Zone).",
    "description": "### Use Case\nThis proposal seeks to leverage ATOM from Hydro to enhance liquidity within Mars Protocol's lending pools on Neutron. By increasing ATOM liquidity, Mars will attract borrower demand, reduce borrowing rates, and support DeFi products that require ATOM as collateral. The borrowed ATOM will power the following initiatives:\n* **Leveraged Staking Vaults:** Enable users to deposit liquid staking tokens (e.g., dATOM or stATOM) to borrow ATOM, restake, and repeat, creating a compounding effect. This strategy enhances returns for LST holders and bolsters adoption of liquid staking across Cosmos.  \n* **Single-Sided LP Vaults:** Provide automated strategies for single-sided liquidity provisioning with hedging capabilities via Mars Perps, enabling Cosmos Hub to supply liquidity without exposure to price fluctuations of paired assets.  \n* **Delta-Neutral Strategies:** Build automated vaults to optimize LPing returns while hedging against market volatility, driving deeper liquidity and higher trading volumes.\nThese strategies are modeled after successful DeFi use cases on Ethereum, aiming to establish Mars Protocol as a key player in ATOM-based DeFi.\n### Duration, Tribute, Yield & Target\nThe tribute will be paid in MARS. The PoL target is 150k ATOM and the expected APR is 7-8% (ATOM lending APY). The deployment duration will be 3 months.\n### Risk Mitigation\n**Overcollateralization:** Lending on Mars Protocol is overcollateralized, minimizing the risk of default. Borrowers are required to maintain a collateralization ratio above the protocol-defined thresholds.\n**Liquidity Caps:** Lending caps ensure sustainable usage of funds.\n### Security\nMars Protocol’s contracts have undergone rigorous [audits](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-audits) by industry-leading firms. dATOM (Drop) is audited by OAK Security, and Mars V2 Perps and lending systems are open-source and fully transparent.\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n### Monitoring\nAll positions can be monitored via [Mars Protocol’s Red Bank UI](https://app.marsprotocol.io/earn). Borrowing rates, utilization, and performance metrics will be transparently reported.

To prevent disrupting natural market dynamics and an excessive dilution of rewards, every lending facility has a limit at 50% of the total amount of liquidity in the pool after Hydro’s deposit. Assuming a successful bid, the Hydro team will adjust the existing position according to the votes obtained, up to the aforementioned 50% cap.\n## Disclaimer\nThis document is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice, a recommendation, or an offer to buy or sell any financial instrument or participate in any investment strategy.

White Whale’s contracts were audited by SCV in November 2022 and April 2023. Vulnerabilities were identified but all were later resolved. Some code changes were made following the audits which warrant an updated security review. |\n| Chain Infrastructure | No independent audits have been performed on Dungeon Chain, but it uses Cosmos SDK with no custom modules, only typical CosmWasm + TokenFactory modules, which have been audited.

No critical issues were found, and all reported findings were resolved by the Oroswap team. The ZIGChain blockchain was audited by Oak Security in August 2025, with all findings (including critical and major issues) resolved except two minor findings that were acknowledged. |\n| Other Considerations | The ZIGChain blockchain consists of a very small controlled set of validators, presenting centralization risk. The blockchain code is not public, preventing independent review. Both Oroswap and ZIGChain have been operating for a relatively short amount of time. |",
