    "title": "Demex ATOM Lending Supply Proposal",
    "description": "### Use case\n\nDeploying ATOM liquidity to Demex's lending market through a phased implementation approach. This will increase the available ATOM for borrowing, potentially reducing borrowing rates and improving overall market efficiency. The supplied ATOM will be used exclusively within Demex's lending protocol, allowing users to borrow ATOM at more competitive rates.\n\nThis bid aims to enhance Demex's ATOM lending market liquidity through a cautious, phased approach. It prioritizes transparency and community involvement while seeking to benefit both lenders and borrowers in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\n### Performance goals\n\nThe performance of this proposal can be monitored through Demex's lending market interface called [Nitron]([https://app.dem.exchange/nitron](https://app.dem.exchange/nitron) ), which will display:  \n1. Total ATOM supplied  \n2. Utilization rate  \n3. Supply APY  \n4. Borrow APY\n\nThe current lending APY for ATOM is at 14% and the borrowing rate is at 23% due to high borrowing demand and insufficient lending supply. The additional ATOM supply will help reduce the ATOM borrowing rate while keeping the lending APY competitive. \n\nHydro Committee can also monitor the performance of deployed liquidity on the following [link](https://scan.carbon.network/cdp/ibc%2FA4DB47A9D3CF9A068D454513891B526702455D3EF08FB9EB558C561F9DC2B701?net=main).\n\nWe project the supply APY for ATOM to be competitive with other lending platforms, estimated at 5-8% APY (variable based on market conditions). \n\n### Tribute & Target\n\nThe tribute will be paid in SWTH. The PoL target is 10,000 ATOM.\n\nPhased Supply Target\n\n* Phase 1 (Initial): 10,000 ATOM  \n* Phase 2 (Evaluation): Monitor for 1 month  \n* Phase 3 (Scaling): Gradually increase the target in the coming rounds to 50,000 ATOM, based on performance and demand\n\n### Risk mitigation\n\nWe will start with a smaller supply to assess the market dynamic. We will monitor the utilization rate to ensure it remains at a healthy level, with a target at 70-80%. Demex also uses a dynamic interest rate model that adjusts based on utilization, helping to maintain market balance\n\nATOM's LTV (Loan-to-value ratio) on Demex is set at 70% which is competitive while remaining safe due to the deep liquidity that ATOM possess\n\nDemex will also provide a withdrawal guarantee. If ATOM cannot be withdrawn at the end of the loan period due to high utilization, additional ATOM will be added to the pool to ensure all loans are repaid.\n\nWe will also have a dedicated team that will monitor the market health and performance of the Demex platform.\n\n### Security  \nThe Demex code is open-source and is available [here](https://github.com/Switcheo/carbon-js-sdk), the current on-chain code is audited by Peck Shield and can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BCgTTyFNW946Z1N-Hxqyz7uGLApF75EM).

In this pilot phase, the PoL target is 5,000 ATOM.\n\n### Risk mitigation\n\nThe target PoL will account for only ~15% of the lending pool, reducing the liquidity risk due to excess loans. Should ATOM loans exceed past target utilization levels, the dynamic Neptune interest rate model will increase exponentially and incentivize the return of loans.\n\nThe committee will also hold the nATOM receipt token for their deposit position and can trade it on the open market if needed.\n\n### Security\n\nNeptune Finance has been audited by Oak Security [here](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/tree/master/Neptune)\nDocs can be found [here](https://docs.nept.finance/)\nEmergency security contact has been provided to the Hydro committee.\n\n### Deployment\n\nNeptune Money Market Contract\n**Inj1nc7gjkf2mhp34a6gquhurg8qahnw5kxs5u3s4u**",
